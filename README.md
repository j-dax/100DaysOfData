# 100 Days of Data Engineering

A repo containing exercises or documents related to growth and understanding of data engineering. The challenge source can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1a5TMdF7Vz-YdvlHXnNHLMeHk7lV-TdRjbPoxMrQ_cSE/htmlview).

### side note

I started storing this halfway through day 3, so I could look back at it later. That's why you won't see anything before day3 and it appears to start in the middle.
